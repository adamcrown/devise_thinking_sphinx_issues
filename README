This is an example Rails App that shows some of the issues that occur when Devise and Thinking Sphinx are used in the same Rails App. Specifically when a Rails Engine includes a model with an index during initialization.

BRANCHES

master:
Is broken. In development you'll Devise routing errors. In production you won't be able to login.

no_define_index_fix:
Is fixed by commenting out devide_index in the mode (basically disabling Thinking Sphinx).

no_require_from_engine_fix:
Is fixed by not requiring the indexed model from the engine.

sphinx_yml_fix:
Is fixed by adding a config/sphinx.yml file that specifies what models should be indexed. This shouldn't be necessary but it does fix the issue. It's definitely the best option of the three fixes.
